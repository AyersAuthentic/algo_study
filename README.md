# Data Structures & Algorithms: Interview Preparation

### About This Repository

This repository documents my journey of building a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms (DSA) for software and data engineering technical interviews. It contains my solutions to problems from platforms like LeetCode, implemented in **Python**.

The focus is not just on finding a correct answer, but on understanding the underlying patterns, analyzing time and space complexity, and writing clean, efficient code.

### My Approach

My study plan is built on a "flywheel" model of consistent, daily effort to build momentum without burnout.

  * **Methodical Progression**: I'm systematically covering one data structure or algorithmic pattern at a time to build a deep understanding from the ground up.
  * **Focus on Optimality**: For each problem, I analyze the brute-force solution before implementing the optimal one, focusing on the trade-offs between approaches (e.g., an $O(n^2)$ vs. an $O(n)$ or $O(n \\log n)$ solution).
  * **Consistent Practice**: I adhere to a daily problem-solving schedule to turn theoretical knowledge into practical, interview-ready skill.
